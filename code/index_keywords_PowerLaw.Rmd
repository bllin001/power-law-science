# Suggested steps

Authors of refered bibliographies suggested the following steps to
analyse dataset.

1.  Initial estimation of $x_{min}$ and $\alpha$, using the methods
    described in Section *Fitting power laws to empirical data*.

2.  Make a CDF (cumulative distribution function) with that.

3.  Kolgomorov-Smirnov test to determine minimum $D$.

4.  Repeat steps 1-3 to scanning whole $(x_{min}, x_{max})$ range to
    identify $x_{min}$ for which $D$ is minimal.

5.  Investigate goodness of fit with bootstrapping, using the method
    described in Section *Testing the power-law hypothesis*.

-   Assign $D_{min}$ to $x_{min}$ which is $D^{real}$.

-   Generate a data sequence of points with bootstrapping and
    determining $D^{syntetic}$.

-   Determine $P$ value of null hypothesis that claims the distribution
    is power-law.

-   If resulting P-value is greater than 0.05 ($p\geq 0.05$) than null
    hypothesis is true (that's say, the power law is a plausible
    hypothesis for the data), otherwise it is rejected.

6.  Fitting real distribution

-   Choose $k_{cut}$ and $k_{sat}$ to optimal cut.

-   Estimate $\alpha$ (scaling parameter).

-   Calculate $D$ with Kolgomorov-Smirnov test.

-   Repeat steps 1-3 to determine real $k_{cut}$ and $k_{sat}$ for which
    $D$ is minimal.

7.  Compare the power law with alternative hypotheses via a likelihood
    ratio test, as described in Section *Alternative distributions*.

-   For each alternative, if the calculated likelihood ratio is
    significantly different from zero, then its sign indicates whether
    the alternative is favored over the power-law model or not.

## Table

```{r}
word_count <- data %>%
  arrange(desc(Total)) %>%
  mutate(count = Total,
         proportion = round(count / sum(count), 2),
         relation = round(first(count) / count, 2),
         rank = row_number(),
  ) %>%
  relocate(rank, .before = Concepts)

df.word_count <- word_count %>% 
  select(rank, Concepts, Total, proportion, relation)

# Display the results in a table
df.word_count %>%
  kable(align = "lcc") %>% 
  kable_styling(latex_options = "HOLD_position") %>%
  kable_classic_2(full_width = FALSE)
```

```{r}
library(openxlsx) 
write.xlsx(df.word_count, "index_keywords_word_count.xlsx", 
           sheetName = "analysis", rowNames = FALSE)
write.csv(df.word_count,file="all_keywords_word_count.csv") 

```

## Plot

```{r}
ggplot(df.word_count, aes(x = rank, y = Total)) + 
  geom_point(color = "blue") +
  theme_bw() + 
  labs(x = "Rank", y = "Count", title = "Ranking Distribution for index keywords") +
  theme(legend.position = "top")

```

As we can see, both in the table and in the graph the most frequent
factor **`r word_count$factor[1]`** will appear approximately:

-   **`r word_count$relation[2]`** times more than the factor
    **`r word_count$factor[2]`**, bearing in mind that, under Zipf's
    law, it should theoretically be **`r word_count$rank[2]`** times
    more.
-   **`r word_count$relation[3]`** times more than the factor
    **`r word_count$factor[3]`**, bearing in mind that, under Zipf's
    law, it should theoretically be **`r word_count$rank[3]`** times
    more.
-   **`r word_count$relation[4]`** times more than the factor
    **`r word_count$factor[4]`**, bearing in mind that, under Zipf's
    law, it should theoretically be **`r word_count$rank[4]`** times
    more.
-   **`r word_count$relation[5]`** times more than the factor
    **`r word_count$factor[5]`**, bearing in mind that, under Zipf's
    law, it should theoretically be **`r word_count$rank[5]`** times
    more.
-   **`r word_count$relation[6]`** times more than the factor
    **`r word_count$factor[6]`**, bearing in mind that, under Zipf's
    law, it should theoretically be **`r word_count$rank[6]`** times
    more.
-   **`r word_count$relation[7]`** times more than the factor
    **`r word_count$factor[7]`**, bearing in mind that, under Zipf's
    law, it should theoretically be **`r word_count$rank[7]`** times
    more.
-   **`r word_count$relation[8]`** times more than the factor
    **`r word_count$factor[8]`**, bearing in mind that, under Zipf's
    law, it should theoretically be **`r word_count$rank[8]`** times
    more.
-   **`r word_count$relation[9]`** times more than the factor
    **`r word_count$factor[9]`**, bearing in mind that, under Zipf's
    law, it should theoretically be **`r word_count$rank[9]`** times
    more.
-   **`r word_count$relation[10]`** times more than the factor
    **`r word_count$factor[10]`**, bearing in mind that, under Zipf's
    law, it should theoretically be **`r word_count$rank[10]`** times
    more.
-   **`r word_count$relation[11]`** times more than the factor
    **`r word_count$factor[11]`**, bearing in mind that, under Zipf's
    law, it should theoretically be **`r word_count$rank[11]`** times
    more.

The last column of the table above shows the relative errors of each
factor. The average of these errors will be the metric we will use to
determine if the observed data are close or not to the theoretical data
defined by Zipf's law. The relative error for this blaming will be
**`r paste0(round(mean(word_count$error)*100,2),"%")`**

# Initial estimation

This estimation calculate $x_{min}$, $\alpha$ and makes CDF and
determine minimum $D$. With `poweRlaw` functions very easy to achive
suggested steps 1-3.

### Fit a discrete power law

We can fit a discrete power law (like this) in the usual way:

```{r}
Valores <- word_count$count
m_pl <- displ$new(Valores)
#m_pl
```

### Estimations: Xmin and $\alpha$

#### General

```{r}
est_pl <- estimate_xmin(m_pl)
est_pl
```

```{r}
MyLabel <- c("Method", "alfa", "sd_alfa", "Xmin", "sd_xmin", "ntail", "sd_ntail", "Stat", "sd_stat", "P_value")
alfa <-round(est_pl$pars, 3)
sd_alfa<-"NA"
xmin <-round(est_pl$xmin, 3)
sd_xmin <-"NA"
ntail <-round(est_pl$ntail, 3)
sd_ntail <-"NA"
stat <- round(est_pl$gof, 3)
sd_stat <-"NA"
P_value <- "NA"
KS_result <- c("MLE-KS",  alfa , sd_alfa, xmin, sd_xmin, ntail, sd_ntail, stat, sd_stat, P_value)

KS_df <- data.frame(rbind(KS_result))
names(KS_df) <- MyLabel
KS_df

```

#### Complete estimations

```{r}
m_pl$setXmin(est_pl)
#m_pl
```

From this results, $x_{min}=$ `r est_pl$xmin` and $\alpha=$
`r est_pl$pars`.

# Investigate goodness of fit



### Bootstrapping (case 2)

For this instance, sampling was conducted across `no_of_sims`= 1,000
bootstraps with `threads`=8 cores. Here is the output and calculated
means and standard deviations:

```{r}
bs_pl <- bootstrap_p(m_pl, no_of_sims=1000, threads=8, seed = 123)
#threads=core number of processor that used by function
#parallel::detectCores() determines how many cores in your computer
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
bs_pl
```

**Comments:**

$x_{min}$ search space truncated at 1e+05. You have three options

1.  Increase $x_{max}$ in `estimate_xmins`

2.  Specify $x_{min}$ explicitly

3.  Ignore and hope for the best (which may be OK)

Some of your data is larger than $x_{max}$. The xmax parameter is the
upper bound of the xmin search space. You could try increasing it. If
the estimated values are below $x_{max}$, it's probably OK not to worry
about this. Expected total run time for 1000 sims, using 1 threads is
3.23 seconds.



```{r}
MyLabel <- c("Method", "alfa", "sd_alfa", "Xmin", "sd_xmin", "ntail", "sd_ntail", "Stat", "sd_stat", "P_value")
alfa <- round(mean(bs_pl$bootstraps[, 3]),3) # Media of pars (es el alfa, exponente)
sd_alfa<-round(sd(bs_pl$bootstraps[, 3]),3) # sd of pars (es el alfa, exponente)
xmin <-round(mean(bs_pl$bootstraps[, 2]),3) # Media of Xmin
sd_xmin <-round(sd(bs_pl$bootstraps[, 2]),3) # sd of Xmin
ntail <-round(mean(bs_pl$bootstraps[, 4]),3) # Media of ntail
sd_ntail <- round(sd(bs_pl$bootstraps[, 4]),3) # sd of ntail
stat <- round(mean(bs_pl$bootstraps[, 1]),3) # Media of gof (es el KS)
sd_stat <- round(sd(bs_pl$bootstraps[, 1]),3) # sd of gof (es el KS)
P_value <- round(bs_pl$p,3)
boot_result <- c("Bootstrapping", alfa , sd_alfa, xmin, sd_xmin, ntail, sd_ntail, stat, sd_stat, P_value)

boot_df <- data.frame(rbind(boot_result))
names(boot_df) <- MyLabel
boot_df
```


The p-value was calculated where the hypothesis is as
follows:

```         
H0: data is generated from a power law distribution

H1: data is not generated from a power law distribution
```

If P value more than 5% means that null hypothesis cannot be rejected
maybe it is a power-law distribution. In this case the generated P value is `r bs_pl$p`, which is high and H0
cannot be rejected at the 5% level of significance. This indicates that
we cannot reject the null hypothesis that the data in question follows a
power law distribution ‚Äî i.e. based on this p-value, we are very
confident that it does.



```{r}
Estimation <- data.frame(rbind(KS_df, boot_df))

library(openxlsx) 
write.xlsx(Estimation, "index_keywords_Estimation.xlsx", 
           sheetName = "results", rowNames = FALSE)
write.csv(Estimation,file="index_keywords_Estimation.csv") 

```
